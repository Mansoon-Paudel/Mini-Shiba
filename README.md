# Mini Shiba Arcade 

A tiny DIY arcade machine built using a **Raspberry Pi Zero 2W**, a joystick, and a single button.  
Created for a school event with **6,000–8,000 attendees** to show that students can build real arcade hardware from scratch.

## What This Is
A small retro-style arcade that boots straight into a simple game Space-Shooter(just a idea).

- Button -> shoot  
- That’s pretty much the whole vibe.
